# Based on https://github.com/CleanroomMC/GroovyScript/blob/63da27acb345aa7af3b8af583cf4c185e0254711/.github/workflows/build.yaml
# This workflow must be manually triggered. It accepts a version and a release type.
# First it sets the version in gradle.properties to the new version and pushes it.
# Then it generates a log, based on commits.
# After that builds a jar and uploads it to curseforge/modrinth/GitHub releases
